								<h2>A little<br />
								about me....</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Hi everyone! My name is Crystal. I recently discovered that I love programming. I began programming in October 2020. I thought it would be something I would like and that it would challenge me. So, I signed up for an intense, immersive boot camp at DigitalCrafts. I always jump in with both feet. I quickly realized that I had wandered into a field that I will never leave.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h2>A few extras about me</h2>
							</header>
								<ul class="skillsIHave">
									<li>I love paddle boarding, kayaking, and yoga, but I am not good at any of these and do not want to seem too granola here, I am just a suburban mom.</li>
									<li>I love growing a vegetable garden every year, but I have only ever produced a handful of tomatoes.</li>
									<li>I really like to stay at home, but I have a long list of places that I long to visit.</li>
									<li>If you do not want me to help you with a puzzle, don't start one in front of me. I love them and can't help myself.</li>
									<li>Everyone who loves me has been beaten by me in Settlers of Catan. It is a puzzle and I will win. Same is true with Boggle.</li>
									<li>It is unhealthy how competitive my family gets at board games. And I am not immune.</li>
									<li>I really love helping people and volunteering for things. I often find myself accidentally in the position of room mom or copy helper at my kid's school. I don't mind.</li>
									<li>Recently, I read a book that had a lot of scientific literature in support of reducing animal product consumption. So I am plant-based now. Show me compelling research and I will be inspired.</li>
									<li>That being said, I have a real weakness for terrible, greasy food. I need a support group.</li>
									<li>I have a very kind husband, two funny kids, one very old and deaf (born that way) dog, one fluffy cat, and a hamster. Quarantine has been a very solid mix of wonderful, crowded, silly, boring, spontaneous, and weird with this group. Everyone is welcome.</li>
								</ul>
							
							<!-- <p>Looking at my work history, you will see that I was a teacher. I have actually taught several times in past. From tutoring grade-school kids while in college, to teaching at math at my old high school, to being a middle grades math and science teacher, to teaching undergrads, and then, finally, to teaching under-priveledged students at an alternative school, I love teaching. Yes, I love my students. They will always be special to me. But most of all, I loved the puzzle of teaching. I loved figuring out how to convince someone to learn something they don't want to try. I loved seeing a student's work and debugging their problems and then debugging their understanding of the subject. Little did I know, I would use both of these skills in programming. Finding ways to convince users to follow certain paths and then constantly debugging my code, combines two of my favorite parts of teaching!</p>
							<p>While studying Entomology for my Master's degree, I quickly learned that, while I enjoy working alone, research was way too lonely for me. I need the team environment that I have found in programming. Whether it is an actual team or the amazing online community that is always willing to offer a debug, programming has proved to be one of the most socially engaging things I have done in my career history. This came as a huge surprise!</p>
							<p>Finally, owning a business has given me the opportunity to really enhance my management and client relation skills. When I entered programming, I definitely was short-sighted and thought that I would be leaving those skills behind. That I would not have much opportunity to interact with clients or be in a manager role. I was so wrong. Already, I have learned about so many roles within programming where these skills will be valued and utilized. Whether talking with my direct team, presenting our builds as we prepare them, or clarifying expectations from clients (i.e. instructors), I am finding that these skills are proving to be incredibly valuable to me!</p> -->

							<h3><strong>SpiderMan</strong></h3>
							<h4>Choose your own adventure!</h4>
							<p>Make smart choices in this for fans only SpiderMan game! Inspired by my daughter's love of SpiderMan and my love for Python, help SpiderMan become a hero!</p>
							<p>This text based game takes users to different locations, allows the player to interact within those locations, and then interact with different characters that are encountered there. The players health and hero impact is influenced by all three parameters. As the user advances through the game, every choice increases in impact. This was an individual project and was my first big python build!</p>

							<h3>Git Ript</h3>
							<p>Track your workouts and stay accountable with Git Ript! Users can set up a profile to see charts and logs of past workouts. Search built in workouts and even create your own workouts! Want to learn a new yoga pose? Search our built in yoga poses and click on the link to see how to acheive it. Love running? Let Git Ript calculate the calories from your run!</p>
							<p>This project was built with a four person team. I was responsible for creating and managing the database as well as creating and connecting the routers and controllers. We also used weight and distance to incorporate a formula that will calculate the calories burned for cardio workouts. We also used a formula to do a query search the will return sums from the data table by day. Future versions will include the ability to build a list of favorite workouts and link up with friends! Everything is more fun when you do it together:)</p>
